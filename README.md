Section: 03

Lecturer: Ts. Dr. Goh Eg Su

This is an introductory course that teaches students how to solve problems and write programs using C++. Covers basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, input/output, arithmetic expressions, decision-making, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and simple file handling. Students learn to design solutions using pseudocode and flowcharts before coding. Through lectures, labs, and assignments, students gain practical experience in writing structured, efficient C++ programs to solve problems of simple to moderate difficulty.
