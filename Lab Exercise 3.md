# Lab Exercise 3
Date: 30 Dec 2025

We are given 30 minutes to complete the task below:

> Write a complete C++ program that produce an "E" pattern as stated in Figure 1. Your program should use 1-dimension array together with for/nested for/while/do...while loops and if/else...if/
switch case control structures if needed. Your program should be simplified as much as
possible to avoid unnecessary/repetitive codes.


My attempt using nested `for` loop:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
